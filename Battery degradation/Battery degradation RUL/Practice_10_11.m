% We said that there is no correlation between the parameters, but is it
% really like this? If we change cycles(N_TRY) we see that with increasing
% N_TRY the correlation happens, as we have it between the parameters.
% First cycle:
% - clouds of points are uncorrelated
% Then:
% - if we increase the number of cycles performed, we find the shape not
%   circular anymore! Then there is correlation
% So our assumption of uncorrelated Gaussian distribution does not hold
% anymore; TRY to put some extradiagonal elements!
% However, convergence of the algorithm happens anyway; with better
% covariance matrix we could only have better results.
% Correlation is due to the fact that parameters in the phenomenon exploit
% dependencies that we did not assume: this happens because particles tend
% to find regions with the maximum likelihood. If we assume correlation,
% maybe reflecting what is happening later, we could exploit better results
% but this correlation will be found anyway.

% % Accuracy decreases while the number of cycles decreases in time. The real
% % goal of the particle filter is to decrease this uncertainty when
% % increasing the number of cycles.
% % NOTE: when we underestimate the capacity of the battery, we underestimate
% % also the RUL, because we expect to have less cycles to live.
% 
% 
% %% Understanding what happens when we change the parameters
% 
% % 1. Number of particles
% %    Let's decrease it to a small number (e.g. 100): we have a smaller
% %    uncertainty than before, because so few particles easily fit the
% %    distribution. So by decreasing this number we "concentrate" them on a
% %    specific region: in fact, at each measurement we "cut" some particles
% %    and resample in a different zone, but this way we get narrower
% %    distributions. However, we lose the capacity to describe the regions
% %    around the mean. Obviously, running becomes faster (less particles).
% %    Estimation is not so bad, but the reason is that we have a very simple
% %    example, since the RUL we are estimating is actually linear!
% %    OBS. When is the RUL not linear? When, for instance, we have a
% %    periodic load.
% %    Let's increase the number of particles (e.g 5000, or 20000):
% %    uncertainty is increasing, but this is not going to last forever: from
% %    a certain point on, uncertainty starts decreasing.
% % 2. Initial state mean and mean covariance (a, b, c)
% %    They depend on how much we know about the parameters (in the process
% %    equation): if we are quite sure about the initial value, we can have
% %    low sigma, otherwise not. For example (keeping num_particles=2500):
% %    - mean multiplied by 0.8: converges to the right estimation then (if
% %      number of particles is enough), except when this value is too low
% %      (since it has to "move" too much). So they will adjust if they have
% %      the same order of magnitude.
% %    - covariance multiplied by 5: it converges to the right distribution,
% %      but at the beginning I have more uncertainty.
% %    OBS. Under- or over-estimation depends on the stochastic nature of the
% %    simulation: every time we are filtering we perform a random sampling
% % 3. Measurement noise (in measurement equation)
% %    This is however something we cannot change in the simulation: we can
% %    only change the sensor, by selecting it when designing the sensor
% %    network. The sensor characteristics can be taken into account when
% %    simulating the system -> process not just in the usage of the
% %    component, but also in the design phase.
% %    If it INCREASES, the uncertainty increases, since all measurements are
% %    affected by an higher noise. This is why we need a proper sensor.
% % 4. sigma_a, sigma_b, sigma_c in the process (transition) function
% %    If I increase them, uncertainty increases. Note that in this case I
% %    have not a defined process law, like the Paris law, but simply a
% %    random walk, taking the old sample and adding a certain noise. Look
% %    also at the states graphs: we are propagating with a BIGGER JUMP!
% %    RUL is very bad, with huge uncertainty.
% 
% % OBS. Why filtering? We have a certain set of particles, but we take only
% % the distribution of particles concentrated in the "right" values -> then
% % we resample to have "concentrated" particles. So I decide to filter the
% % particles to concentrate on the right region, and this is done by Bayes
% % theorem (through the use of misurations).
% % In fact, at a given time instant, I have that the capacity uncertainty
% % increases if I propagate up to a certain threshold. How? Through the
% % PROCESS EQUATION, APPLIED TO EACH SINGLE PARTICLE! If I do something like
% % this I clearly see that my distribution has this behavior; particles are
% % close if we are at the end, then uncertainty is not increasing; if we are
% % at the beginning, uncertainty is huge instead and it propagates more!
